- 👋 Hi, I’m Bruno
- 👀 I’m interested in MLOps, LLMOps, Clean Code, and Design Patterns
- 🐱 My favorite software is Git (although I'm no expert 🤓)
- 🛠 I'm currently working as a Software Developer/LLM Engineer (Python) to build LLM systems
- 🤗 In my free time I try to learn new concepts that interest me!
  - Right now I'm exploring the 🤗 Transformers course of Hugging Face (it's awesome, by the way! Both the course and the Hugging Face's platform)
  - I'm also learning some JavaScript! I'm still a noob though, as you can see from my [mini projects](https://github.com/2010b9/js-mini-projects) 😅
- 📑 I've studied Math, Computer Science and have a Master's Degree in Data Science
- 📫 You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-vaz-162203197) or through my email 2010b9@gmail.com
